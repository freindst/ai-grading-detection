  "original_grade": "90",
  "grading_reason": "The paper demonstrates a strong understanding of programming language foundations and paradigms. The student provides clear explanations of syntax, semantics, and pragmatics, and effectively compares compiled and interpreted languages. The essay also offers insightful discussions on various programming styles and the role of virtual machines in cross-platform compatibility. However, there are a few areas for improvement. The paper could benefit from more real-world examples to illustrate the practical applications of different paradigms. Additionally, while the paper cites sources, it would be beneficial to include an explicit list of references in APA format at the end of the essay. Lastly, the student mentions hybrid programming styles but does not delve deeply into this topic.",
  "student_feedback": "Great job on your research paper! You've done a fantastic job explaining the theoretical foundations and classification of programming languages. Your understanding of syntax, semantics, pragmatics, and various paradigms is impressive. To improve, consider adding more real-world examples to help illustrate the practical applications of different paradigms. Also, remember to include an explicit list of references in APA format at the end of your paper.",
